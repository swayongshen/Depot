Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /home/swayongshen/Documents/Wright/learning_phase_project/depot/public/packs
[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
	["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

You’ll find that\n      all those “hard” things aren’t so difficult after all, and your code\n      will run orders of magnitude faster.\n      </p>\n        <div class=\"price_line\">\n          <span class=\"price\">$46.00</span>\n          <form class=\"button_to\" method=\"post\" action=\"/line_items?product_id=3\" data-remote=\"true\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to cart\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"IJ7YwG8IVz89jMgSnUFzZqVzjk8kC-8_kPMpjCZ8wB6MCnxWhN9JshNkGyUUTzsD0nZF5ugUQvfMgjOhuy20IQ\" /></form>\n          <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/assets/favicon-32x32-bc60e6a6ca433178fb64583135458010b4a6aa18ccd7013235e99182caba5ec7.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"entry\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/rails-5ea4520dc811d8d1094cd7c4b487f9373c2559f928dbc3e78a31e5238371e740.png\" />\n        <h3>IsThisAJAX</h3>\n        Bro\n        <div class=\"price_line\">\n          <span class=\"price\">$123.00</span>\n          <form class=\"button_to\" method=\"post\" action=\"/line_items?product_id=4\" data-remote=\"true\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to cart\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"CdT_aAv_At1-vDtHjwWpWARjkCySZv2hy2cVbsN5aj-lQFv-4CgcUFBU6HAGC-E9c2ZbhV55UGmXFg9DXigeAA\" /></form>\n          <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/assets/favicon-32x32-bc60e6a6ca433178fb64583135458010b4a6aa18ccd7013235e99182caba5ec7.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"entry\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/rails-5ea4520dc811d8d1094cd7c4b487f9373c2559f928dbc3e78a31e5238371e740.png\" />\n        <h3>Test</h3>\n        Remote\n        <div class=\"price_line\">\n          <span class=\"price\">$1,233.00</span>\n          <form class=\"button_to\" method=\"post\" action=\"/line_items?product_id=5\" data-remote=\"true\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to cart\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"QuXlcsCN8qXYR3KjQImKiD5lgGBxb9YQ_TsH4WuiOALucUHkK1rsKPavoZTJh8LtSWBLyb1we9ihSh3M9vNMPQ\" /></form>\n          <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/assets/favicon-32x32-bc60e6a6ca433178fb64583135458010b4a6aa18ccd7013235e99182caba5ec7.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"entry\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/rails-5ea4520dc811d8d1094cd7c4b487f9373c2559f928dbc3e78a31e5238371e740.png\" />\n        <h3>s</h3>\n        ss\n        <div class=\"price_line\">\n          <span class=\"price\">$123.00</span>\n          <form class=\"button_to\" method=\"post\" action=\"/line_items?product_id=6\" data-remote=\"true\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to cart\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"VZYY5Uihw4lJEYV2xwqz29XJK9q5X-SymNnqbLRartr5Arxzo3bdBGf5VkFOBPu-oszgc3VASXrEqPBBKQva5Q\" /></form>\n          <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/assets/favicon-32x32-bc60e6a6ca433178fb64583135458010b4a6aa18ccd7013235e99182caba5ec7.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"entry\">\n        <img src=\"/assets/7apps-902a7fcba2fb72309a4e03f51b11df7455b49870ab7d972a13e1c80de2be8989.jpg\" />\n        <h3>Seven Mobile Apps in Seven Weeks</h3>\n        <p>\r\n      <em>Native Apps, Multiple Platforms</em>\r\n      Answer the question “Can we build this for ALL the devices?” with a\r\n      resounding YES.
